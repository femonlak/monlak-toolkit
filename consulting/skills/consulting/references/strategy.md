## McKinsey 7S Framework

**Origin**: Developed by McKinsey consultants Tom Peters and Robert Waterman in the 1980s

**Purpose**: Analyze organizational effectiveness through 7 interconnected elements.

### The 7 Elements

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  Shared Values  │  (Center - connects all)
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
        ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐

   └─────────┘         └───────────┘        └─────────┘
```

### Hard vs Soft Elements

**Questions**:
- Is the structure centralized or decentralized?
- How are decisions made?
- Are there clear lines of responsibility?

#### 3. Systems

## Porter's Five Forces

**Origin**: Michael Porter, Harvard Business School, 1979

**Purpose**: Analyze industry structure and competitive intensity to assess profitability potential.

### The Five Forces

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │   Threat of New     │
                    │      Entrants       │
                    └──────────┬──────────┘
                               │
                               ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌───────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Bargaining    │    │   Industry    │    │   Bargaining    │
│   Power of      │◄───│   Rivalry     │───►│   Power of      │
│   Suppliers     │    │  (Center)     │    │   Buyers        │
└─────────────────┘    └───────┬───────┘    └─────────────────┘
                               │
                               ▼
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │  Threat of          │
                    │  Substitutes        │
                    └─────────────────────┘
```

### Detailed Force Analysis

#### 1. Threat of New Entrants

**Barriers to entry**:
- Economies of scale
- Capital requirements
- Brand loyalty
- Switching costs
- Access to distribution
- Government regulations
- Proprietary technology

**High barrier = Low threat = Good for incumbents**

#### 2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers

**Suppliers are powerful when**:
- Few suppliers dominate
- No substitutes available
- Supplier's product is differentiated
- High switching costs
- Supplier can forward integrate

#### 3. Bargaining Power of Buyers

**Buyers are powerful when**:
- Few buyers, high volume
- Products are standardized
- Low switching costs
- Buyers can backward integrate
- Product is not important to buyer's quality

#### 4. Threat of Substitutes

**Substitutes are threatening when**:
- Price-performance ratio is attractive
- Switching costs are low
- Buyer propensity to substitute is high

**Note**: Substitutes are different from competitors - they fulfill the same need differently

#### 5. Industry Rivalry

**Rivalry is intense when**:
- Many competitors of similar size
- Slow industry growth
- High fixed costs
- Low differentiation
- High exit barriers
- Diverse competitors

### Scoring Template

| Force | Score (1-5) | Key Factors |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| New Entrants | | |
| Supplier Power | | |
| Buyer Power | | |
| Substitutes | | |
| Rivalry | | |
| **Overall** | | |

**Scoring**: 1 = Very Low, 5 = Very High (higher = worse for industry profitability)

               │       ★         │    MARKS ?      │
    MARKET     │                 │                 │
    GROWTH     │  Invest heavily │ Invest or divest│
               ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
         Low   │   CASH COWS     │      DOGS       │
               │       $         │       ✗         │
               │                 │                 │
               │ Milk for cash   │ Divest or hold  │
               └─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Category Strategies

| Category | Characteristics | Strategy |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Stars** | High growth, High share | Invest to maintain leadership |
| **Cash Cows** | Low growth, High share | Harvest profits, minimal investment |
| **Question Marks** | High growth, Low share | Invest to grow or divest |
| **Dogs** | Low growth, Low share | Divest or manage for cash |

### Ideal Portfolio Flow

```
Question Mark → Star → Cash Cow → (Fund new Question Marks)
                                         ↓
                                    Eventually retire

### Four Actions Framework (ERRC)

| Action | Question | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **E**liminate | Which factors should be eliminated? | Remove costly factors with little value |
| **R**educe | Which factors should be reduced below standard? | Cut over-designed elements |

| **C**reate | Which factors should be created that never existed? | Offer unprecedented value |

### Six Paths Framework

Look across:
1. **Alternative industries** - not just competitors
2. **Strategic groups** - different tiers within industry
3. **Buyer groups** - purchasers, users, influencers
4. **Complementary offerings** - what happens before/during/after
5. **Functional-emotional orientation** - switch the appeal
6. **Time** - trends that affect value

## VRIO Framework

**Origin**: Jay Barney, 1991 (Resource-Based View)

**Purpose**: Assess if resources/capabilities provide sustainable competitive advantage.

### The VRIO Questions

| Criterion | Question | If No... |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **V**aluable | Does it help exploit opportunities or neutralize threats? | Competitive disadvantage |
| **R**are | Is it scarce among competitors? | Competitive parity |
| **I**mitable | Is it costly for others to imitate? | Temporary advantage |
| **O**rganized | Is the firm organized to capture value? | Unrealized advantage |

### VRIO Analysis Flow

```
Is the resource VALUABLE?
        │
        ├── No → Competitive Disadvantage
        │
        └── Yes → Is it RARE?
                    │
                    ├── No → Competitive Parity
                    │
                    └── Yes → Is it hard to IMITATE?
                                │
                                ├── No → Temporary Advantage

### Strategy Details

| Strategy | How to Win | Requirements | Risks |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Cost Leadership** | Lowest cost producer | Scale, efficiency, tight cost control | Technology changes, imitation |
| **Differentiation** | Unique value customers will pay for | Innovation, marketing, quality | Customers may not pay premium |
| **Focus (Cost)** | Lowest cost in niche segment | Deep segment knowledge | Segment may shrink |
| **Focus (Differentiation)** | Unique value in niche segment | Specialization | Broader competitors enter niche |

### Stuck in the Middle

Companies that fail to pursue a clear strategy get "stuck in the middle":
- Neither lowest cost nor differentiated
- Below-average profitability
- Unclear value proposition

### Strategy Alignment

| Strategy | Value Chain Focus | Organization | Culture |
|----------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| Cost Leadership | Operations, procurement | Centralized, efficiency | Cost-conscious |
| Differentiation | R&D, marketing | Decentralized, creative | Innovation-driven |
| Focus | Customer intimacy | Specialized | Customer-obsessed |
