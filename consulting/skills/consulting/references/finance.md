# Financial Analysis Frameworks

Frameworks for evaluating investments, building business cases, and making financial decisions.

## Return on Investment (ROI)

**Purpose**: Measure the gain or loss generated relative to the investment cost.

### Formula

```
ROI = (Net Benefit / Cost) × 100%

Where:
- Net Benefit = Total Benefits - Total Costs
- Cost = Initial Investment
```

### Example

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Initial Investment | $100,000 |
| Annual Benefits | $40,000 |
| Annual Costs | $10,000 |
| Time Period | 3 years |

**Calculation**:
- Total Benefits: $40,000 × 3 = $120,000
- Total Costs: $100,000 + ($10,000 × 3) = $130,000
- Net Benefit: $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000
- ROI: (-$10,000 / $100,000) × 100% = **-10%**

### ROI Limitations

- Doesn't account for time value of money
- Doesn't consider risk
- Can be manipulated by timeframe selection
- Ignores qualitative benefits

---

## Net Present Value (NPV)

**Purpose**: Calculate the present value of future cash flows, accounting for the time value of money.

### Formula

```
NPV = Σ [Cash Flow_t / (1 + r)^t] - Initial Investment

Where:
- t = time period
- r = discount rate
- Cash Flow_t = cash flow in period t
```

### Simplified Table Approach

| Year | Cash Flow | Discount Factor (10%) | Present Value |
|------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|
| 0 | -$100,000 | 1.000 | -$100,000 |
| 1 | $30,000 | 0.909 | $27,270 |
| 2 | $35,000 | 0.826 | $28,910 |
| 3 | $40,000 | 0.751 | $30,040 |
| 4 | $45,000 | 0.683 | $30,735 |
| **NPV** | | | **$16,955** |

### Discount Factors

| Rate | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 5% | 0.952 | 0.907 | 0.864 | 0.823 | 0.784 |
| 8% | 0.926 | 0.857 | 0.794 | 0.735 | 0.681 |
| 10% | 0.909 | 0.826 | 0.751 | 0.683 | 0.621 |
| 12% | 0.893 | 0.797 | 0.712 | 0.636 | 0.567 |
| 15% | 0.870 | 0.756 | 0.658 | 0.572 | 0.497 |

### NPV Decision Rule

- **NPV > 0**: Project creates value → Accept
- **NPV < 0**: Project destroys value → Reject
- **NPV = 0**: Project breaks even → Indifferent

---

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

**Purpose**: Find the discount rate at which NPV equals zero.

### Interpretation

- IRR is the project's "break-even" discount rate
- Compare IRR to your required rate of return (hurdle rate)

### Decision Rule

- **IRR > Hurdle Rate**: Accept
- **IRR < Hurdle Rate**: Reject

### Example

If a project has an IRR of 15% and your company's cost of capital is 10%:
- The project returns more than it costs to fund → Accept

### IRR Limitations

- Assumes reinvestment at IRR rate
- Can give multiple values with non-conventional cash flows
- Doesn't account for project size
- Use NPV for mutually exclusive projects

---

## Payback Period

**Purpose**: Determine how long it takes to recover the initial investment.

### Simple Payback

```
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Flow

Example:
- Investment: $100,000
- Annual Cash Flow: $25,000
- Payback: $100,000 / $25,000 = 4 years
```

### Uneven Cash Flows

| Year | Cash Flow | Cumulative Cash Flow |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| 0 | -$100,000 | -$100,000 |
| 1 | $20,000 | -$80,000 |
| 2 | $30,000 | -$50,000 |
| 3 | $40,000 | -$10,000 |
| 4 | $50,000 | +$40,000 |

**Payback**: 3 years + ($10,000 / $50,000) = **3.2 years**

### Discounted Payback

Same approach but using present values of cash flows.

### Payback Limitations

- Ignores cash flows after payback
- Ignores time value of money (unless discounted)
- Doesn't measure profitability
- Arbitrary acceptance threshold

## Break-Even Analysis

**Purpose**: Determine the point where revenue equals costs.

### Formula

```
Break-Even Units = Fixed Costs / (Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)

Break-Even Revenue = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin Ratio

Where:
- Contribution Margin = Price - Variable Cost
- Contribution Margin Ratio = Contribution Margin / Price
```

### Example

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Fixed Costs | $50,000/month |
| Price per Unit | $100 |
| Variable Cost per Unit | $60 |
| Contribution Margin | $40 |

**Break-Even Units**: $50,000 / $40 = **1,250 units/month**
**Break-Even Revenue**: 1,250 × $100 = **$125,000/month**

### Break-Even Chart

```

## Sensitivity Analysis

**Purpose**: Understand how changes in assumptions affect outcomes.

### One-Way Sensitivity

Test one variable at a time:

| Variable | Base Case | -20% | -10% | +10% | +20% |
|----------|-----------|------|------|------|------|
| Revenue | $1M NPV | $0.6M | $0.8M | $1.2M | $1.4M |
| Costs | $1M NPV | $1.3M | $1.15M | $0.85M | $0.7M |
| Discount Rate | $1M NPV | $1.2M | $1.1M | $0.9M | $0.8M |

              │       │      │       │       │
   Revenue    ████████████████████████████████
   Costs      ██████████████████████████
   Volume     █████████████████████
   Price      ███████████████
   Timing     █████████
```

### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Description | Probability | NPV |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Best Case | High demand, low costs | 20% | $2.5M |
| Base Case | Expected outcomes | 60% | $1.0M |
| Worst Case | Low demand, high costs | 20% | -$0.5M |

**Expected NPV** = (0.2 × $2.5M) + (0.6 × $1.0M) + (0.2 × -$0.5M) = **$1.0M**

## Quick Decision Guide

| When to Use | Framework |
|-------------|-----------|
| Simple comparison of alternatives | ROI |
| Long-term investments with many cash flows | NPV |
| Finding the break-even return rate | IRR |
| Risk-averse, need quick recovery | Payback |
| Pricing and volume decisions | Break-Even |
| Understanding key drivers | Sensitivity |
| Complete investment decision | Business Case |

### Decision Hierarchy

1. **NPV** is the gold standard - maximizes shareholder value
2. **IRR** is useful for comparing projects of similar risk
3. **Payback** adds a liquidity/risk constraint
4. **ROI** is simple but should be supplementary
